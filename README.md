# About Tutor Manager
This app is a personal app for managing my tutoring business. Here is a list of planned high-level features:

* Track attendance (for both tutor and tutee) 
* Send invoices at the end of the month
* Provide analytics into revenue

Further down the line, core functionality and data will move to a server. This will make a mobile app client possible, and enable real-time updates, notifications and more.

# Note
Not useable at the moment. Still under active development.
